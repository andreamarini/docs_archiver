FX's scripts for science and chemistry
======================================

This rep contains scripts that I use regularly, in the hope that others
might find them useful. Below is a description of each, roughly classified
by "category".


**Bibliography**

- doi2bib: give it a DOI, it gives you a full bib entry
- extractdoi: gets DOI from PDF (when possible)
- texsize: list size of all figures included in TeX document

**Computational chemistry**

- findsym.py: find space group of crystal structures (front-end to ASE/spglib routines)

**Grace (xmgrace) scripts**
