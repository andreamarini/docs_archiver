A single ?-band tight binding hamiltonian is considered and the magnetic ?eld is theoretically described by following the Peierls approximation into the hopping energies. Our emphasis is put on investigating the main effects of the geometri- cal aspects and relative positions of the tubes on the local density of states and on the conductance of the system. By considering intershell interactions between a set of neighboring atoms on the walls of the inner and outer tubes, we study the possibility of founding Aharonov-Bohm effects in the DWCNs when a magnetic ?eld is applied along the axial direction.},

    abstract  	 = {In this work we present theoretical calculations and analysis of the vibronic structure of the spin-triplet optical transition in diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The electronic structure of the defect is described using accurate first-principles methods based on hybrid functionals. We devise a computational methodology to determine the coupling between electrons and phonons during an optical transition in the dilute limit. As a result, our approach yields a smooth spectral function of electron–phonon coupling and includes both quasi-localized and bulk phonons on equal footings. The luminescence lineshape is determined via the generating function approach. We obtain a highly accurate description of the luminescence band, including all key parameters such as the Huang–Rhys factor, the Debye–Waller factor, and the frequency of the dominant phonon mode. More importantly, our work provides insight into the vibrational structure of NV centres, in particular the role of local modes and vibrational resonances. In particular, we find that the pronounced mode at 65 meV is a vibrational resonance, and we quantify localization properties of this mode. These excellent results for the benchmark diamond (NV) centre provide confidence that the procedure can be applied to other defects, including alternative systems that are being considered for applications in quantum information processing.},

Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the GW approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the GW approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the GW approximation.},

Rev. B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys. 2013 88, 235113]. This approach allows one to go beyond the independent particle description used in standard first-principles nonlinear optics calculations by including quasiparticle corrections (by means of the GW approximation), crystal local field effects and excitonic effects. Our results show that the SHG spectra obtained using the latter approach differ significantly from their independent particle counterparts. In particular they show strong excitonic resonances at which the SHG intensity is about two times stronger than within the independent particle approximation. All the systems studied (whose stabilities have been predicted theoretically) are transparent and at the same time exhibit a remarkable SHG intensity in the range of frequencies at which Ti:sapphire and Nd:YAG lasers operate; thus they can be of interest for nanoscale nonlinear frequency conversion devices. Specifically the SHG intensity at 800 nm (1.55 eV) ranges from about 40-80 pm V-1 in ZnO and GaN to 0.6 nm V-1 in SiC. The latter value in particular is 1 order of magnitude larger than values in standard nonlinear crystals.},

    abstract   	 = {Time-dependent (TD) density functional theory (TDDFT) promises a numerically tractable account of many-body electron dynamics provided good simple approximations are developed for the exchange-correlation (XC) potential functional (XCPF). The theory is usually applied within the adiabatic XCPF approximation, appropriate for slowly varying TD driving fields. As the frequency and strength of these fields grows, it is widely held that memory effects kick in and the eligibility of the adiabatic XCPF approximation deteriorates irreversibly. We point out, however, that when a finite system of electrons in its ground-state is gradually exposed to a very a high-frequency and eventually ultra-strong homogeneous electric field, the adiabatic XCPF approximation is in fact rigorously applicable. This result shows that adiabatic XCPF has a larger scope of applicability than previously suspected and in this sense is compliant with recent numerical findings by Thiele et al. [M. Thiele, E.K.U. Gross, S. K?mmel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 (2008) 153004] of negligible memory effects in strong-field double ionization.},

Two-state models, the harmonic, and the Condon approximations are used for the calculations, making them easily applicable to larger molecules. The method is applied to nine pristine lower and higher diamondoids: adamantane, diamantane, triamantane, and three isomers each of tetramantane and pentamantane. We also consider a hybrid species "Dia},

This paper discusses the experimental manifestations of this effect, from its first footprint in the total yields of multiply charged ions to the highly differential cross-sections for ion and electron production, and the theoretical models that have been set up for their description. Except for the <i>ab initio</i> solution of the time-dependent Schr?dinger equation, most models implement the recollision mechanism. The kinematical constraints imposed by the former are extensively discussed. A fully quantum-mechanical formalisation of the recollision model in terms of the lowest-order <i>S</i>-matrix element for this process is introduced and its limitations are discussed. Various simplifications are proposed that drop more and more of the quantum features. This is contrasted with purely classical trajectory descriptions with no approximations to the dynamics.},

In this work, we present ab initio calculations of hot electrons in gallium arsenide (GaAs) using density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. Our computed electron–phonon relaxation times at the onset of the Γ, L, and X valleys are in excellent agreement with ultrafast optical experiments and show that the ultrafast (tens of femtoseconds) hot electron decay times observed experimentally arise from electron–phonon scattering. This result is an important advance to resolve a controversy on hot electron cooling in GaAs. We further find that, contrary to common notions, all optical and acoustic modes contribute substantially to electron–phonon scattering, with a dominant contribution from transverse acoustic modes. This work provides definitive microscopic insight into hot electrons in GaAs and enables accurate ab initio computation of hot carriers in advanced materials.},

Within the framework of quantum kinetic equations in the second Born approximation we study the relevance of retardation (memory) effects, energy broadening and correlation build-up for femtosecond relaxation processes. Furthermore, the important issue of total energy conservation, within various well-established approximation schemes, is analysed. The most important non-Markovian effect is shown to be the broadening of the energy delta function leading to an increase of kinetic energy with time. Our numerical analysis includes both the single-time kinetic equation and the full two-time Kadanoff - Baym equations. Our results are expected to correctly reproduce qualitative features of non-Markovian dynamics in plasmas, fluids, nuclear matter and in the intraband relaxation of semiconductors. The comparison of the exact solutions for different approximations allows suggestions for simplifications that make this kind of calculation and their extension, especially to realistic semiconductor situations, more feasible.},

Structure in the imaginary component of the dielectric response is analysed using critical point line shapes, and the origins of the major transitions in MgO and MgAl 2 O 4 are determined using an ab initio pseudofunction band structure calculation of MgO. The exciton reflectivity has been studied in the three materials at temperatures between 300 and 1500 K, and exciton-phonon coupling appears to increase from MgO to α-Al 2 O 3 . The temperature dependence of the higher lying interband transitions in MgO has been determined to 1100 K, and we find that while the temperature dependence of the onset transitions at Γ and X are nearly identical (− 1.22meV/K at Γ), higher lying transitions have very different temperature dependences. Furthermore with increasing temperature the X point valence band separation increases at a rate of 0.38meV/K, while the conduction band separation at X decreases at −0.41meV/K.},

    abstract  	 = {For the calculation of neutral excitations, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is an exact reformulation of the many-body time-dependent Schrödinger equation, based on knowledge of the density instead of the many-body wavefunction. The density can be determined in an efficient scheme by solving one-particle non-interacting Schrödinger equations—the Kohn–Sham equations. The complication of the problem is hidden in the—unknown—time-dependent exchange and correlation potential that appears in the Kohn–Sham equations and for which it is essential to find good approximations. Many approximations have been suggested and tested for finite systems, where even the very simple adiabatic local-density approximation (ALDA) has often proved to be successful. In the case of solids, ALDA fails to reproduce optical absorption spectra, which are instead well described by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). On the other hand, ALDA can lead to excellent results for loss functions (at vanishing and finite momentum transfer). In view of this and thanks to recent successful developments of improved linear-response kernels derived from MBPT, TDDFT is today considered a promising alternative to MBPT for the calculation of electronic spectra, even for solids. After reviewing the fundamentals of TDDFT within linear response, we discuss different approaches and a variety of applications to extended systems.},

Here, we report the application of isolated attosecond pulses to prompt ionization of the amino acid phenylalanine and the subsequent detection of ultrafast dynamics on a sub\textendash4.5-femtosecond temporal scale, which is shorter than the vibrational response of the molecule. The ability to initiate and observe such electronic dynamics in polyatomic molecules represents a crucial step forward in attosecond science, which is progressively moving toward the investigation of more and more complex systems.Over the past decade, laser technology has pushed back the fastest directly observable time scale from femtoseconds (quadrillionths of a second) to attoseconds (quintillionths of a second). For the most part, attosecond studies so far have probed very simple molecules such as H2 and O2. Calegari et al. now look at a more elaborate molecule\textemdashthe amino acid phenylalanine. They tracked changes in the electronic structure of the compound after absorption of an ultrafast pulse, before the onset of conventional vibrational motion.Science, this issue p. 336},

    abstract     	 = {It has been recently shown, using ab-initio methods, that bulk diamond is characterized by a large band-gap renormalization (Ã¢ÂÂ¼0.6 eV) induced by the electron-phonon interaction. In this work we show that in polymers, compared to bulk materials, the larger amplitude of the atomic vibrations makes the real excitations of the system be composed by entangled electron-phonon states. We prove that these states carry only a fraction of the electronic charge, thus leading, inevitably, to the failure of the electronic picture. The present results cast doubts on the accuracy of purely electronic calculations. They also lead to a critical revision of the state-of-the-art description of carbon-based nanostructures, opening a wealth of potential implications.},

    abstract  	 = {Considerable progress has been made in recent years in the field of ab initio calculations of electronic band structures of semiconductors and insulators. The one-electron states (and the concomitant two-particle excitations) have been obtained without adjustable parameters, with a high degree of reliability. Also, more recently, the electron-hole excitation frequencies responsible for optical spectra have been calculated. These calculations, however, are performed with the constituent atoms fixed in their crystallographic positions and thus neglect the effects of the lattice vibrations (i.e. electron-phonon interaction) which can be rather large, even larger than the error bars assumed for ab initio calculations. Effects of electron-phonon interactions on the band structure can be experimentally investigated in detail by measuring the temperature dependence of energy gaps or critical points (van Hove singularities) of the optical excitation spectra. These studies have been complemented in recent years by observing the dependence of such spectra on isotopic mass whenever different stable isotopes of a given atom are available at affordable prices. In crystals composed of different atoms, the effect of the vibration of each separate atom can thus be investigated by isotopic substitution. Because of the zero-point vibrations, such effects are present even at zero temperature (T},

    abstract        	 = {It has long been known that only one-electron excitations are available from adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). This is particularly clear in Casida's formulation of TDDFT linear response theory [M. E. Casida, in Recent Advances in Density Functional Methods, Part I, edited by D. P. Chong (World Scientific, Singapore, 1995), p. 155]. Nevertheless the explicit inclusion of two- and higher-electron excitations is necessary for an adequate description of some excited states, notably the first excited singlet states of butadiene and quartet excited states of molecules with a doublet ground state. The equation-of-motion superoperator approach is used here to derive a Casida-like propagator equation which can be clearly separated into an adiabatic part and a nonadiabatic part. The adiabatic part is identified as corresponding to Casida's equation for adiabatic TDDFT linear response theory. This equivalence is confirmed by deriving a general formula which includes the result that Gonze and Scheffler derived to show the equivalence of TDDFT and Gorling-Levy adiabatic connection perturbation theory for the exchange-only optimized effective potential [X. Gonze and M. Scheffler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4416 (1999)]. The nonadiabatic part explicitly corrects adiabatic TDDFT for two- and higher-electron excitations. The ``dressed TDDFT'' of Maitra, Zhang, Cave, and Burke is obtained as a special case where the ground state is closed shell [N. T. Maitra, F. Zhang, R. J. Cave, and K. Burke, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 5932 (2004)]. The extension of dressed TDDFT to the case where the ground state is an open-shell doublet is presented, highlighting the importance of correctly accounting for symmetry in this theory. The extension to other ground state spin symmetries is a straightforward consequence of the present work. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

    abstract       	 = {The nature and energetics of the low-lying singlet states of polyenes have presented significant challenges for electronic structure methods. This is particularly true for conventional implementations of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), which, because of their use of the adiabatic approximation, have difficulty in describing states of `doubly-excited character'. We show that use of our recently developed `Dressed TDDFT' approach provides a compact and accurate method for treating these doubly excited states, by use of a frequency-dependent exchange-correlation kernel. We present results for the vertical absorption energy for the 2(1)A(g) states of butadiene and hexatriene, and the vertical fluorescence and 0-0 transitions for the 2(1)A(g) state of butadiene.

    abstract  	 = {The general theory and experimental considerations are presented for a novel all-optical time-domain technique for measuring low frequency vibrational modes of surfaces (phonons or adsorbate vibrational modes). A pump-laser pulse impulsively drives an initial displacement of the surface atoms. The subsequent free-induction decay of the coherent phonon modes of the surface atoms is detected by time-resolved second-harmonic generation (SHG). The spectral features are recovered by fitting the time-domain data to exponentially decaying sinusoids. This all-optical probe has advantages over inelastic particle scattering techniques because it can be applied at buried interfaces. It has signal to noise advantages over linear and spontaneous Raman techniques. This technique is demonstrated by measurement of surface optical phonon spectra on the clean GaAs (110)–relaxed–(1×1), GaAs (100)–(1×6), and GaAs (100)–(4×1) in UHV and of a local monolayer-scale interfacial mode at the buried native-oxide-covered GaAs (100). The chemical sensitivity is demonstrated by in situ oxidation of the GaAs (100)–(4×6). The general mechanism of generating coherent surface phonons is discussed in light of the symmetry selection rules.},

The absorption spectra exhibit rich absorption peaks, mainly owing to many zero-dimensional discrete states. They strongly depend on the length, the radius, the chiral angles, and the magnetic flux. The absorption peaks gradually group together as the length increases. The threshold excitation energy ([omega]th) decreases in the increasing of radius. The dependence of [omega]th on length is monotonous for zigzag nanotubes, while it is oscillatory for armchair nanotubes. The threshold excitation energy is constant for the sufficiently long carbon nanotubes. Chiral carbon nanotubes exhibit very complicated optical spectra, compared with achiral carbon nanotubes. The magnetic flux reduces the threshold excitation energy and increases the number of absorption peaks.},

In this problem, carrier distributions are extremely far from equilibrium and nonequilibrium LO phonons are generated at the center of the Brillouin zone. We solve numerically a system of three transport equations, namely one for the conduction band, one for the valence band and one for the LO phonons. Contrary to all previous work, we do not assume that carrier distributions are nondegenerate so that we can investigate the following problems: (a) conditions of internal thermalization in degenerate nonequilibrium plasma (thermalization time, influence of screening on the energy-loss rate, formation of nonequilibrium LO phonons) and (b) absorption saturation and transmission of the pumplaser pulse.},

Our ?exact? result provides a benchmark against which various approximate forms for vxc can be compared.

A helium gas in femtosecond laser pulses at long wave lengths (?~700 nm) and high intensities (I~1015 W/cm2) produces surprisingly high numbers of He2+ ions. These laser fields cause large and fast electron oscillations, which makes a solution of the time-dependent Schr?dinger equation numerically demanding. The system can be studied using a one-dimensional model atom, which has many of the same properties as the He atom. Using the one-dimensional model, the importance of including electron correlation in a simplified description of the two-electron dynamics is demonstrated. It is shown that electron correlation becomes much less important if the laser field has a short wave length, in which case the electron oscillations are smaller and slower. The problem of including electron correlation in the calculations is discussed in terms of approaches such as time-dependent Hartree?Fock, time-dependent density functional theory and time-dependent extended Hartree?Fock. Some of the commonly used semi-classical models for describing the double-ionization process are presented.},

We show that ISTLS corresponds to an f(xc) that is nonlocal in space but has only a trivial frequency dependence, and only a very simple tensorial structure. We propose approaches that may obtain more realistic structure while retaining the positive ISTLS features, namely that strong spatial inhomogeneity is allowed, with a kernel that contains physics specific to the inhomogeneous system under study, rather than being based on uniform-gas data.},

Unlike previous memory-XC potentials, our vXC is not limited to the linear response regime. The proposed form of vXC is a generalized local-density approximation chosen so as to satisfy the nonlinear harmonic potential theorem and Newton's third law. For the case of the inhomogeneous electron gas, we give an explicit prescription for vXC based solely on an existing parametrization of the linear XC response kernel fXChom(n,?) of the uniform gas. Application to quantum wells seems promising.},

    abstract  	 = {Black phosphorus has recently emerged as a promising material for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic device for its high mobility, tunable mid-infrared bandgap, and anisotropic electronic properties. Dynamical evolution of photoexcited carriers and the induced transient change of electronic properties are critical for materials’ high-field performance but remain to be explored for black phosphorus. In this work, we perform angle-resolved transient reflection spectroscopy to study the dynamical evolution of anisotropic properties of black phosphorus under photoexcitation. We find that the anisotropy of reflectivity is enhanced in the pump-induced quasi-equilibrium state, suggesting an extraordinary enhancement of the anisotropy in dynamical conductivity in hot carrier dominated regime. These results raise attractive possibilities of creating high-field, angle-sensitive electronic, optoelectronic, and remote sensing devices exploiting the dynamical electronic anisotropy with black phosphorus.},

The derivation is based on a theorem by Hunter stating that the wave function of the complete system of electrons and nuclei can be written, without approximation, as a Born\textendashOppenheimer (BO)-type product of a nuclear wave function, X(R), and an electronic one, ΦR(r), which depends parametrically on the nuclear configuration R. From the variational principle, we deduce formally exact equations for ΦR(r) and X(R). The algebraic structure of the exact nuclear equation coincides with the corresponding one in the adiabatic approximation. The electronic equation, however, contains terms not appearing in the adiabatic case, which couple the electronic and the nuclear wave functions and account for the electron\textendashnuclear correlation beyond the BO level. It is proposed that these terms can be incorporated using an optimized local effective potential.},

We address these problems with time-dependent density matrix functional theory (TDDMFT). For two-electron systems the exact exchange-correlation functional is known in DMFT, hence exact response equations can be formulated. This affords a study of the performance of TDDMFT in the TDDFT failure cases mentioned (which are all strikingly exhibited by prototype two-electron systems such as dissociating H-2 and HeH+). At the same time, adiabatic approximations, which will eventually be necessary, can be tested without being obscured by approximations in the functional. We find the following: (a) In the fully nonadiabatic (omega-dependent, exact) formulation of linear response TDDMFT, it can be shown that linear response (LR)-TDDMFT is able to provide exact excitation energies, in particular, the first order (linear response) formulation does not prohibit the correct representation of doubly excited states; (b) within previously formulated simple adiabatic approximations the bonding-to-antibonding excited state surface as well as charge transfer excitations are described without problems, but not the double excitations; (c) an adiabatic approximation is formulated in which also the double excitations are fully accounted for.},

Beyond the computation of the total energy, charge density and electronic structure of such systems, ABINIT also implements many dynamical, dielectric, thermodynamical, mechanical, or electronic properties, at different levels of approximation. The present paper provides an exhaustive account of the capabilities of ABINIT. It should be helpful to scientists that are not familiarized with ABINIT, as well as to already regular users. First, we give a broad overview of ABINIT, including the list of the capabilities and how to access them. Then, we present in more details the recent, advanced, developments of ABINIT, with adequate references to the underlying theory, as well as the relevant input variables, tests and, if available, ABINIT tutorials.},

The method can be used starting from density functional theory calculations performed with semilocal or hybrid functionals. We applied the newly developed technique to GW calculations of systems of unprecedented size, including water/semiconductor interfaces with thousands of electrons.},

    abstract  	 = {The treatment of the Random-Phase Approximation Hamiltonians, encountered in different frameworks, like time-dependent density functional theory or Bethe-Salpeter equation, is complicated by their non-Hermicity. Compared to their Hermitian Hamiltonian counterparts, computational methods for the treatment of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are often less efficient and less stable, sometimes leading to the breakdown of the method. Recently [Gr?ning et al. Nano Lett. 8 (2009) 2820], we have identified that such Hamiltonians are usually pseudo-Hermitian. Exploiting this property, we have implemented an algorithm of the Lanczos type for Random-Phase Approximation Hamiltonians that benefits from the same stability and computational load as its Hermitian counterpart, and applied it to the study of the optical response of carbon nanotubes. We present here the related theoretical grounds and technical details, and study the performance of the algorithm for the calculation of the optical absorption of a molecule within the Bethe-Salpeter equation framework.},

    abstract  	 = {Within the Tamm?Dancoff approximation, ab initio approaches describe excitons as packets of electron?hole pairs propagating only forward in time. However, we show that in nanoscale materials excitons and plasmons hybridize, creating exciton-plasmon states where the electron?hole pairs oscillate back and forth in time. Then, as exemplified by the trans-azobenzene molecule and the carbon nanotubes, the Tamm?Dancoff approximation yields errors larger than the accuracy claimed in ab initio calculations. Instead, we propose a general and efficient approach that avoids the Tamm?Dancoff approximation, correctly describes excitons, plasmons, and exciton-plasmon states, and provides a good agreement with experimental results.},

We incorporate the effect of the latter interaction into a non-adiabatic frequency-dependent and spatially non-local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) kernel f(Hxc)(CEDA) (r(1), r(2), omega), the explicit analytical expression of which is derived for interacting single and double excitations well separated from the other excitations, within the common energy denominator approximation (CEDA) for the Kohn-Sham (KS) and interacting density response functions, chi(s) and chi, respectively. The kernel f(Hxc)(CEDA) (r(1), r(2), omega) obtained from the direct analytical inverse of chi(CEDA)(s) and chi(CEDA) is a sum of the delta-function and non-local orbital-dependent spatial terms with frequency-dependent factors, with which f(Hxc)(CEDA) acquires a modulated quadratic dependence on omega. The effective incorporation in f(Hxc)(CEDA) of the complete manifold of excited states (through the delta function term) represents an extension of the kernel reported by Maitra, Zhang, Cave, and Burke [J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 120, 5932]. In the TDDFT eigenvalue equations considered in the diagonal approximation, f(Hxc)(CEDA) generates two excitation energies omega(q) and omega(q+1), which both correspond to the same single KS excitation omega(s)(q), thus producing the effect of the single-double excitation interaction.},

    abstract     	 = {A density-functional formalism comparable to the theory of Hohenberg, Kohn and Sham is developed for electronic systems subject to time-dependent external fields. The formalism leads to a set of time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations which, in addition to the external potential, contain a time-dependent Hartree term and a local time-dependent exchange-correlation potential. Rigorous properties and explicit approximations of the latter are discussed in detail. Generalizations of the basic formalism to incorporate the nuclear motion and to deal with magnetic effects are described. Within the regime of linear-response theory, the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations lead to a formally exact representation of the frequency-dependent linear density response. Applications within the linear-response regime include the computation of photoabsorbtion cross sections, the determination of van der Waals forces and the calculation of excitation energies. The latter is based on the fact that the frequency-dependent linear density response has poles at the true excitation energies of the interacting many-body system. The time-dependent Kohn-Sham formalism then leads to a simple additive correction of the Kohn-Sham single-particle excitation energies. Beyond the linear-response regime, the time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme is applied to atoms in strong femto-second laser pulses to describe multi-photon ionization and harmonic generation in a non-perturbative way.},

This has important consequences for elec- trical properties of these materials: charge transport is usually limited by the most dif?cult hopping processes and is therefore dominated by the disordered matrix, resulting in low charge- carrier mobilities2 (?10?5 cm2 V?1 s?1). Here we use thin-?lm, ?eld-effect transistor structures to probe the transport properties of the ordered microcrystalline domains in the conjugated poly- mer poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT. Self-organization in P3HT results in a lamella structure with two-dimensional conjugated sheets formed by interchain stacking. We ?nd that, depending on processing conditions, the lamellae can adopt two different orientations?parallel and normal to the substrate?the mobil- ities of which differ by more than a factor of 100, and can reach values as high as 0.1 cm2 V?1 s?1 (refs 3, 4). Optical spectroscopy of the ?eld-induced charge, combined with the mobility anisotropy, reveals the two-dimensional interchain character of the polaronic charge carriers, which exhibit lower relaxation energies than the corresponding radical cations on isolated one-dimensional chains. The possibility of achieving high mobilities via two- dimensional transport in self-organized conjugated lamellae is important for applications of polymer transistors in logic circuits5 and active-matrix displays4,6.},

These subjects play a crucial role in a num- ber of currently highly active areas of research: high temperature and organic superconductors, quantum phase transitions, correlated fermion systems, quantum wires, the quantum Hall e?ect, low?dimensional magnetism, and probably some others. Some understanding of this physics thus certainly should be useful in a variety of areas, and it is hoped that these notes will be helpful in this. As the subject of these lectures was quite similar to those delivered at Les Houches, some overlap in the notes[1] was unavoidable. However, a number of improvements have been made, for example a discussion of the ?Klein factors? occurring in the bosonization of one?dimensional fermions, and new material added, mainly concerning spin chains and coupled Luttinger liquids. Some attempt has been made to keep references up to date, but this certainly has not always been successful, so we apologize in advance for any omissions (but then, these are lecture notes, not a review article).},

By these means we get a spectral function which decays in the form of a power of a hyperbolic secans. For short time intervals the decay of the retarded Green function starts with zero slope, while the long-time behaviour is exponential. The real part of the Fourier transform of a hyperbolic secans is again a hyperbolic secans which is localised enough in frequency space, so that run-away effects of the asymptotic kinetics are avoided.},

It is predicted that an electron at the bottom of the conduction band should have an asymmetry index comparable to that of a core electron and that the strengths of its plasmon satellites should be similar to those of a core electron. The width of their plasmon satellites, however, should become smaller under the influence of recoil. In essence, our results show that the exchange-correlation hole left after a photoemitted conduction electron has a very similar effect as the core hole left after a photoemitted core electron. Use of synchrotron radiation gives high enough a resolution to make possible the verification of these effects.},

Starting with Dyson's equation for the nonequilibrium exciton propagator the shift and damping of exciton-levels due to exciton-exciton interaction are calculated in a local approximation with respect to the density of excitons. As a consequence, the Boltzmann equation of excitons contains many-exciton contributions in the diffusion- and drift-term as well as in the collision integral. The corresponding diffusion equation is derived yielding a diffusion coefficient decreasing with increasing density and a density dependent source term due to the action of the light field.

By the variational derivation technique a set of equations for the Green's functions and the self-energy is obtained, which is formally closed and should be an appropriate starting point for any kind of iteration or approximation. The connection of this technique with the diagram technique given by Keldysh and the translation technique for thermodynamic Green's functions according to Kadanoff and Baym is demonstrated. The general equations are then exactly transformed to difference and sum coordinates, enabling an adequate approximation in the case of slowly varuing (in space and time) external fields in terms of local quantities. In linear approximation with respect to the drift operator DÃÂ a generalized Boltzmann equation is derived, which clearly exhibits many-body effects in all drift and collision contributions.},

In combination with the frequency-dependent exact-exchange kernel the present approach describes long-range charge-transfer excitations qualitatively correct in contrast to standard TDDFT methods, as shown by formal analysis and applications to molecular systems. Even charge-transfer excitations obtained with the adiabatic frequency-independent exact-exchange kernel exhibit a long-range dependence with the distance of the charge transfer, which, however, is too weak by a factor of 2. This indicates that it is not the frequency dependence of the kernel alone that leads to a correct description of charge-transfer excitations.},

Both the correlation potential and energy can be strongly nonlocal in time. A new inequality is derived for the time-dependent exchange-correlation energy. The correlation energy appears to scale to a constant function of scaled time in the high-density limit. In the linear response regime, the correlation energy is shown to become purely adiabatic, but the correlation potential is generally nonadiabatic. The usefulness of the virial theorem as a test of numerical accuracy is demonstrated. All results are found or inspired by exact numerical solution of a simple model system (Hooke's atom), and inversion of the corresponding Kohn?Sham equations.},

With sub-10\thinspacefs laser pulses, one can impulsively excite the coherent phonons of a frequency up to 50\thinspaceTHz, and detect them optically as a periodic modulation of electric susceptibility. The generation and relaxation processes depend critically on the coupling of the phonon mode to photoexcited electrons. Real-time observation of coherent phonons can thus offer crucial insight into the dynamic nature of the coupling, especially in extremely nonequilibrium conditions under intense photoexcitation.},

    abstract   	 = {CONJUGATED polymers are organic semiconductors, the semiconducting behaviour being associated with the pi molecular orbitals delocalized along the polymer chain. Their main advantage over non-polymeric organic semiconductors is the possibility of processing the polymer to form useful and robust structures. The response of the system to electronic excitation is nonlinear?the injection of an electron and a hole on the conjugated chain can lead to a self-localized excited state which can then decay radiatively, suggesting the possibility of using these materials in electroluminescent devices. We demonstrate here that poly(p-phenylene vinylene), prepared by way of a solution-processable precursor, can be used as the active element in a large-area light-emitting diode. The combination of good structural properties of this polymer, its ease of fabrication, and light emission in the green?yellow part of the spectrum with reasonably high efficiency, suggest that the polymer can be used for the development of large-area light-emitting displays.},

    abstract   	 = {The time-dependent local-density approximation ?TDLDA? has been widely applied to the collective electronic excitations of atomic clusters, starting with jellium calculations by Ekardt.1 The usual formalism is based on linear response with frequency rather than time as a variable. The resulting Green?s function equations may be solved directly in coordinate space1?4 or in a particle-hole con?gurational representation.5?7 The direct coordinate-space method is very ef?cient when the system has spherical symmetry, reducing the integral equation to a one-dimensional equation. However, realistic theory requires that the ion cores be treated explicitly, losing the spherical symmetry. Then the Green?s function method requires a matrix representation of operators on in three-dimensional space, which makes the overall dimensionality too large to handle. The con?gurational representation, on the other hand, is limited by the dimensionality of the particle-hole space. This depends on the number of particles in the system calculated; for moderate numbers of particles in three dimensions it is more practical than the other methods. We think that the most effective method for large numbers of particles in three dimensions is to go back to the time representation and explicitly calculate the time evolution of the initial con?guration. Since only a single Slater determinant is evolved, one does not get into the multiplicity problem of the particle-hole representation. And because the Hamiltonian matrix is rather sparse in a coordinate-space representation, one avoids the very large matrix dimensionality problem of the Green?s function method. We shall illustrate the method with several examples, taken from alkali metal clusters and C 60 molecules. Our pseudopotentials are constructed following the method of Troullier and Martins.8 We ?rst calculate local pseudopotentials in the s and p waves de?ned to produce pseudo-wavefunctions that match the Hartree-Fock wave functions smoothly at a certain radius r c . The pseudopotential in the Hamiltonian has two parts, a local potential identical to the p-wave pseudopotential, and a separable nonlocal potential},

The first type suggests that there are continuous metallic paths, with conduction limited by regions behaving as disordered metals in parallel with regions involving tunnelling or hopping. The second type is also consistent with this model if there is an additional conductivity term arising from electron-electron interactions, as expected if the disordered metal barrier region is near the metal-semiconductor transition. Our simple heterogeneous model is able to give a good fit to the conductivity temperature dependence of all the samples.},

We succeed in giving evidence for the transition from an exciton-dominated population to an unbound electron-hole pair population as the pair density increases. For pair densities below this excitonic Mott transition we observe a spectrally separate emission from free electron-hole pairs in addition to excitonic luminescence, thereby proving the coexistence of both species. Exciton binding energy and band gap remain unchanged even near the upper bound of this coexistence region. Above the Mott density we observe a purely exponential high energy tail of the photoluminescence and a redshift of the band gap with pair density. The transition occurs gradually between 1x10(10) and 1x10(11) cm(-2) at the carrier temperatures of our experiment.},

    abstract   	 = {The valley pseudospin is a degree of freedom that emerges in atomically thin two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2). The capability to manipulate it, in analogy to the control of spin in spintronics, can open up exciting opportunities. Here, we demonstrate that an ultrafast and ultrahigh valley pseudo-magnetic field can be generated by using circularly polarized femtosecond pulses to selectively control the valley degree of freedom in monolayer MX2. Using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy, we observed a pure and valley-selective optical Stark effect in WSe2 monolayers from the nonresonant pump, resulting in an energy splitting of more than 10 milli\textendashelectron volts between the K and K' valley exciton transitions. Our study opens up the possibility to coherently manipulate the valley polarization for quantum information applications. The electronic structure of atomic layers of transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as WSe2, has two distinct valleys with equal energies. Knowing which valley an electron comes from can make it a carrier of information. Kim et al. used optical methods to distinguish between the valleys. They shone circularly polarized light on a sample of WSe2, which caused the energy needed to create an exciton\textemdasha bound state of an electron and a hole\textemdashto shift in one valley but not the other. The method may enable the manipulation of the valley degree of freedom for use in quantum information processing. Science, this issue p. 1205},

We report the effect of pulse shaping on the size and morphology of the deposited structures of Au, Zn, Cr on a function of the pulse separation time $\Delta$t (from 0 to 10 ps) of double pulses of variable intensities generated by using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM). The observed differences in size and morphology are correlated with the outcome of pump-probe experiments for the study of electron-phonon scattering dynamics and subsequent energy transfer processes to the bulk in the different metals employed. We propose that in metals with weak electron-lattice coupling, the electron ballistic motion and the resulting fast electron scattering at the film surface, as well as the internal electron thermalization process are crucial to the morphology and size of the transferred material. Therefore, temporal shaping within the corresponding time scales of these processes may be used for tailoring the features of the metallic structures obtained by LIFT.},

In contrast to the widely spread picture of the excitonic Mott transition as an unbinding transition where the correlation length of a bound electron-hole pair gradually increases until an ionized plasma is formed, the number of incoherent excitons is found to decrease continuously while the mean separation between electrons and holes within the remaining bound pairs is hardly changed, i.e., the pairs remain well correlated. In fact, the remaining excitons have a mean electron-hole separation even below that of an isolated single pair.},

Similar studies of conjugated organic molecules of interest in optoelectronics are often hampered by difficulties in growing well-ordered and well-oriented crystals or films. We have grown crystalline films of uniaxially oriented sexiphenyl molecules and obtained ARPES data. Supported by density-functional calculations, we show that, in the direction parallel to the principal molecular axis, a quasi?one-dimensional band structure of a system of well-defined finite size develops out of individual molecular orbitals. In contrast, perpendicular to the molecules, the band structure reflects the periodicity of the molecular crystal, and continuous bands with a large dispersion were observed.},

Numerical values of thresholds obtained through a two-temperature model are in good agreement with experimental data. The dependence of fluence thresholds on both wavelength and pulse width is explored and discussed in detail.},

In the former case, we explain how an adiabatic kernel, which has no frequency-dependence, can yet generate the strongly frequency-dependent resonant structures in the interacting response function, not present in the Kohn-Sham response function. In the case of the bound double-excitation, we explain that a strongly frequency-dependent kernel is needed, and derive one as an a posteriori correction to the usual adiabatic approximations in TDDFT. Our approximation becomes exact for an isolated resonance in the limit of weak interaction, where one discrete state interacts with one continuum. We derive a ``Fano TDDFT kernel'' that reproduces the Fano lineshape within the TDDFT formalism, and also a dressed kernel, that operates on top of an adiabatic approximation. We illustrate our results on a simple model system.},

The focus here is on four major themes: the motivation for orbital-dependent functionals in terms of limitations of semilocal functionals; the optimized effective potential as a rigorous approach to incorporating orbital-dependent functionals within the Kohn-Sham framework; the rationale behind and advantages and limitations of four popular classes of orbital-dependent functionals; and the use of orbital-dependent functionals for predicting excited-state properties. For each of these issues, both formal and practical aspects are assessed.},

    abstract   	 = {Electron dynamics in metallic clusters are examined using a time-dependent density functional theory that includes a "memory term," i.e., attempts to describe temporal nonlocal correlations. Using the Iwamoto, Gross, and Kohn exchange-correlation (XC) kernel, we construct a translationally invariant memory action from which an XC potential is derived that is translationally covariant and exerts zero net force on the electrons. An efficient and stable numerical method to solve the resulting Kohn-Sham equations is presented. Using this framework, we study memory effects on electron dynamics in spherical jellium gold clusters. We find memory significantly broadens the surface plasmon absorption line, yet considerably less than measured in real gold clusters, attributed to the inadequacy of the jellium model. Memory effects on nonlinear spectroscopy are studied as well: a real-time pump-probe setup is used to study the temporal decay profile of the plasmon, finding a fast decay followed by slower tail; and in high harmonic generation, we show that memory narrows and redshifts emission lines.},

Incorporating such ?memory? terms into XC potentials is complicated by the constraint that the derived force and torque densities must integrate to zero at every instance. This requirement can be met by deriving the potentials from an XC action that is both rotationally and translationally invariant, i.e., Galilean invariant (GI). We develop a class of simple but flexible forms for an action that respect these constraints. The basic idea is to formulate the action in terms of the Eularian-Lagrangian transformation metric tensor, which is itself GI. The general form of the XC potentials in this class is then derived, and the linear response limit is derived as well.},

The electronic structure and linear optical response have been calculated from the KohnÃ¢ÂÂSham band structure applying (semi)local as well as nonlocal screened hybrid exchangeÃ¢ÂÂcorrelation density functionals. Single-particle excitations are treated within the GW approximation for independent quasiparticles. For optical response calculations, two-particle excitations have been included by solving the BetheÃ¢ÂÂSalpeter equation for Coulomb correlated electronÃ¢ÂÂhole pairs. On this methodological basis, gap data and optical spectra for the three major phases of TiO 2 are provided. The common characteristics of brookite with the rutile and anatase phases, which have been discussed more comprehensively in the literature, are highlighted. Furthermore, the comparison of the present calculations with measured optical response data of rutile indicate that discrepancies discussed in numerous earlier studies are due to the measurements rather than related to an insufficient theoretical description.},

    abstract   	 = {Given the absence of a Coulomb singularity in the quantum regime, the dependence of dynamical screening in non-equilibrium carrier?carrier scattering on the dimension of GaAs was examined using the generalized Kadanoff?Baym equation. The screening in a quantum well is stronger than that in the bulk but this has not been previously understood. This dependence also applies to the Fr?hlich interaction because, in momentum space, the electric flux density of small-angle scattering is stronger in a lower dimension. Calculations also revealed the memory effect; based on these, the quantum kinetic oscillation was conceptualized. As time evolves, the scattering rate increases at the early stage and causes hole burning in the carrier's distribution. This effect enables the dependence of the average relaxation time on the carrier density to become independent of the sample's dimension, unlike in the Boltzmann regime. This work can eliminate the apparent contradiction between Shank's and Haug's experimental results. Finally, an experimental problem regarding the anomalously fast thermalization of non-equilibrium carriers immersed in cold electrons in a quantum well was investigated and a reasonable explanation is presented.

For the main first-order Raman peaks, the intensity maximum occurs at [similar]2.8 eV for single layered and at [similar]2.5 eV for few-layered MoS2, which correspond to the band-gap energy. At the excitation energy of 1.96 eV, several anomalous behaviors are observed. Many second-order peaks are anomalously enhanced even though the main first-order peaks are not enhanced. In the low-frequency region (<100 cm-1), a broad peak centered at [similar]38 cm-1 and its second order peak at 76 cm-1 appear for the excitation energy of 1.96 eV. These anomalous resonance effects are interpreted as occuring due to the strong resonance with excitons or exciton-polaritons.},

This approach solves some theoretical dif?culties in the standard derivation of the electron-phonon interaction. We do not make a Born-Oppenheimer approximation from the outset but transform the electronic coordinates to a frame attached to the nuclear framework. Subsequently coupled equations are derived which connect the nuclear density-density correlation function to the electron Green function, the screened interaction, and the vertex. This set of equations is completely equivalent to the full problem and therefore higher-order effects are ? systematically included. The derived equations are further compared to those obtained from the Frohlich Hamiltonian. It is shown that careless use of this Hamiltonian leads to double counting but also insight is given why use of this Hamiltonian has led to many useful results. Finally a simple method is presented that allows for the inclusion of electron-phonon coupling within a density-functional context.},

Of particular interest for TDDFT is the relation to nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF), which allows us to construct exchangecorrelation potentials with memory by using diagrammatic techniques. For many problems, such as quantum transport or atoms in intense laser pulses, one needs exchange-correlation functionals with memory, and Green function techniques offer a systematic method for developing these. The Keldysh formalism is also necessary for defining response functions in TDDFT and for defining an action functional needed for deriving TDDFT from a variational principle. In this chapter, we give an introduction to the nonequilibrium Green function formalism, intended to illustrate the usefulness of the theory. The formalism does not differ much from ordinary equilibrum theory, the main difference being that all time-dependent functions are defined for time-arguments on a contour, known as the Keldysh contour.},

Here, we show that the entire spectrum of excitonic resonances blue shifts under this transition, with excited states showing larger shifts, approaching 100 meV for a 1 nm diameter nanotube. The excitonic binding energy, Coulomb self-energy correction, and dielectric shift under the BST are estimated. Analysis of this blue shift reveals the dominant effect of dielectric screening on SWNT excitonic states.},

The two-electron momentum distributions exhibit a clear transition from nonsequential to sequential double ionization. We provide strong evidence that rescattering is responsible for nonsequential ionization by calculating the momentum spectrum of the He2+ recoil ions?which we find in excellent agreement with recent experiments?and by analyzing the electronic center-of-mass motion via Wigner transforms.},

As a test of several of the available approximations for the exchange-correlation kernel, or equivalently the local-field factor, we calculate the uniform-gas correlation energy. While the random phase approximation (fxc = 0) makes the correlation energy per electron too negative by about 0.5 eV, the adiabatic local-density approximation [fxc = fxc(q = 0,? = 0)] makes a comparable error in the opposite direction. The adiabatic nonlocal approximation [fxc = fxc(q,? = 0)] reduces this error to about 0.1 eV, and inclusion of the full frequency dependence [fxc = fxc(q,?)] in an approximate parametrization reduces it further to less than 0.02 eV. We also report the wave-vector analysis and the imaginary-frequency analysis of the correlation energy for each choice of kernel.},

This breakdown of time-dependent V-representability can be tracked down to problems with the continuity equation which arise from discretization of the kinetic-energy operator. Examples are given for lattices with two points and with N points, and implications for practical numerical applications of time-dependent density-functional theory are discussed.

In TDDFT, the one-to-one mapping is between densities and potentials for a given initial-state. This means that the potentials, most generally, are functionals of the initial state of the system, as well as of the density; and, not just of the instantaneous density, but of its entire history. These dependences are explicitly displayed in (1.33) of Chap. 1. Of particular interest is the xc potential, as that is the quantity that must be approximated. This is the difference between the KS potential and the sum of the external and Hartree potentials. The Hartree potential has no memory, as the classical Coulomb interaction depends on the instantaneous density only, but since both the interacting and non-interacting mappings can depend on the initial state, the xc potential must be a functional of both the initial states and density.},

An expression for the latter is derived, that becomes exact in the limit that the charge-transfer excitations are well separated from other excitations. The exchange-correlation kernel has the task of undoing the static correlation in the ground state introduced by the step, in order to accurately recover the physical charge-transfer states.

    abstract        	 = {Adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory fails for excitations of a heteroatomic molecule composed of two open-shell fragments at large separation. Strong frequency dependence of the exchange-correlation kernel is necessary for both local and charge-transfer excitations. The root of this is the static correlation created by the step in the exact Kohn-Sham ground-state potential between the two fragments. An approximate nonempirical kernel is derived for excited molecular dissociation curves at large separation. Our result is also relevant when the usual local and semilocal approximations are used for the ground-state potential, as static correlation there arises from the coalescence of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbital energies as the molecule dissociates.

    abstract  	 = {The carrier dynamics in bulk Silicon, a paradigmatic indirect gap semiconductor, is studied by using the BaymÃ¢ÂÂKadanoff equations. Both the electronÃ¢ÂÂelectron (eÃ¢ÂÂe) and electronÃ¢ÂÂphonon (eÃ¢ÂÂp) self-energies are calculated fully abÃ¢ÂÂinitio by using a semiÃ¢ÂÂstatic outÃ¢ÂÂofÃ¢ÂÂ equilibrium GW approximation in the eÃ¢ÂÂe case and a Fan selfÃ¢ÂÂenergy in the e-p case. By using the generalized BaymÃ¢ÂÂKadanoff ansatz the twoÃ¢ÂÂtime evolution is replaced by the only dynamics on the macroscopic time axis. The enormous numerical difficulties connected with a realÃ¢ÂÂtime simulation of realistic systems is overcome by using a completed collision approximation that further simplifies the memory effects connected to the time evolution. The carrier dynamics is shown to reduce in such a way to have stringent connections to the wellÃ¢ÂÂknown equilibrium electronÃ¢ÂÂelectron and electronÃ¢ÂÂphonon selfÃ¢ÂÂenergies. This link allows to use general arguments to motivate the relative balance between the eÃ¢ÂÂe and eÃ¢ÂÂp scattering channels on the basis of the carrier energies.},

    abstract  	 = {The structural, phonon, and thermodynamic properties of six TiO2 polymorphs, i.e., rutile, anatase, columbite, baddeleyite, orthorhombic I, and cotunnite, have been systematically investigated by density functional theory. The predicted volumes, bulk modulus, and Debye temperature are in good agreement with experiments. The phonon dispersions of the TiO2 polymorphs were studied by the supercell approach, whereas the long-range dipoleÃ¢ÂÂdipole interactions were calculated by linear response theory to reproduce the LOÃ¢ÂÂTO splitting, making accurate prediction of phonon frequencies for the polar material TiO2. The calculated phonon dispersions show that all TiO2 polymorphs are dynamically stable at ambient pressure, indicating the high-pressure phases might be quenched to ambient conditions as ultrahard materials. Furthermore, the finite temperature thermodynamic properties of TiO2 polymorphs were predicted accurately from the obtained phonon density of states, which is critical in the future study of the pressureÃ¢ÂÂtemperature phase diagram of TiO2. The calculated Gibbs energies reveal that rutile is more stable than anatase at ambient pressure. We derived the Gibbs energy and heat capacity functions for all TiO2 polymorphs for use in thermodynamic modeling of phase equilibria.},

Their effect on the Dirac electrons of graphene is known to induce some spectacular and purely quantistic phenomena, like the Casimir and the Aharanov-Bohm effects. In this work we demonstrate, by using a first-principles approach, that the Dirac cone of graphene is also affected by a sizeable Lamb shift. We show that the microscopic electronic currents flowing on the graphene plane are strongly coupled with the vacuum fluctuations causing a renormalisation of the electronic levels (as large as 4 meV). This shift is one order of magnitude larger than the value predicted for an isolated carbon atom, which imposes a reinterpretation of the Lamb shift as a collective effect.},

In this way the optical properties of a medium can be dramatically modi?ed, leading to electromagnetically induced transparency and related effects, which have placed gas-phase systems at the center of recent advances in the development of media with radically new optical properties. This article reviews these advances and the new possibilities they offer for nonlinear optics and quantum information science. As a basis for the theory of electromagnetically induced transparency the authors consider the atomic dynamics and the optical response of the medium to a continuous-wave laser. They then discuss pulse propagation and the adiabatic evolution of ?eld-coupled states and show how coherently prepared media can be used to improve frequency conversion in nonlinear optical mixing experiments. The extension of these concepts to very weak optical ?elds in the few-photon limit is then examined. The review concludes with a discussion of future prospects and potential new applications.},

    abstract  	 = {In single-layer WSe2, a paradigmatic semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide, a circularly polarized laser field can selectively excite electronic transitions in one of the inequivalent K± valleys. Such selective valley population corresponds to a pseudospin polarization. This can be used as a degree of freedom in a “valleytronic” device provided that the time scale for its depolarization is sufficiently large. Yet, the mechanism behind the valley depolarization still remains heavily debated. Recent time-dependent Kerr experiments have provided an accurate way to visualize the valley dynamics by measuring the rotation of a linearly polarized probe pulse applied after a circularly polarized pump pulse. We present here a clear, accurate and parameter-free description of the valley dynamics. By using an atomistic, ab initio approach, we fully disclose the elemental mechanisms that dictate the depolarization effects. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent time-dependent Kerr experiments. We explain the Kerr dynamics and its temperature dependence in terms of electron–phonon-mediated processes that induce spin–flip intervalley transitions.},

    abstract  	 = {Optical spectroscopy of conjugated molecules is described by using collective electronic coordinates, which represent the joint dynamics of electron-hole pairs. The approach relates the optical signals directly to the dynamics of charges and bond orders (electronic coherences) induced by the radiation field and uses only ground-state information, thus avoiding the explicit calculation of excited molecular states. The resulting real-space picture is reminiscent of the normal-mode analysis of molecular vibrations and offers a unified framework for the treatment of other types of systems including semiconductor nanostructures and biological complexes. Spatial coherence displayed in two-dimensional plots of the five electronic normal modes that dominate the optical response of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) oligomers with up to 50 repeat units (398 carbon atoms) in the 1.5- to 8-electronvolt frequency range suggests a saturation to bulk behavior at about five repeat units.},

We show that the time-ordered Green’s function obeys a conventional Dyson equation only at equilibrium and in the limit of zero temperature. In all other cases, i.e. finite temperature at equilibrium or non-equilibrium, the time-ordered Green’s function obeys instead a modified Dyson equation. The derivation of this result is obtained from the general formalism of the non-equilibrium Green’s functions on the Keldysh time-loop contour. At equilibrium, our result is fully consistent with the Matsubara temperature Green’s function formalism and also justifies rigorously the correction terms introduced in an ad hoc way with Hedin and Lundqvist. Our results show that one should use the appropriate dynamical equation for the time-ordered Green’s function when working beyond the equilibrium zero-temperature limit.},

This paper presents a time-dependent extension of the GC method as a new approach to improve existing approximations of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT). The time-dependent GC method is shown to be a conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into any existing adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied to driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic potential (Hooke's atom). It is demonstrated that a proper choice of time-dependent generator coordinates in conjunction with the adiabatic local-density approximation reproduces the exact linear and nonlinear two-electron dynamics quite accurately, including features associated with double excitations that cannot be captured by TDDFT in the adiabatic approximation.},

The mobility expression is evaluated with parameters from density functional theory, and application to naphthalene crystals demonstrates substantial progress in the simulated temperature dependence and relative magnitudes for all transport directions. The scattering by phonons is described in a manner that goes beyond the Holstein model for small polarons and, consequently, significantly improves the temperature dependence and anisotropy of carrier mobility with respect to the previous narrow-band theory. The contributions of coherent and incoherent scattering processes are analyzed. Special emphasis is placed on the origin and understanding of the transition from band transport at low temperatures to hopping at high temperatures, both of which are fully included in the theory. Additionally, in contrast to earlier narrow-band theories, the unphysical divergence at zero temperatures is removed.},

Two different approaches for calculating the dielectric screening will be described. In both cases a parallel and efficient iterative algorithm to find numerically the solution of the BSE equation has been implemented. In fact, if the surface states are not energetically separated from the bulk states and if one is interested in describing a large energy window, the traditional approach involving a full diagonalization of a very large excitonic Hamiltonian is prohibitive. The reflectance anisotropy spectrum of the monohydride Si(100) is considered and compared with experiments. A comparison of the results obtained within different treatments of the electron?hole screening is made. Convergence and numerical problems are discussed.},

Using time-independent perturbation theory we show how the standard approaches for studying vibronic effects in molecules and those for addressing electronÃ¢ÂÂphonon interactions in solids correspond to slightly different choices for the non-interacting Hamiltonian. Our present approach naturally leads to the AllenÃ¢ÂÂHeine theory of temperature-dependent energy levels, the FranckÃ¢ÂÂCondon principle, the HerzbergÃ¢ÂÂTeller effect and to phonon-assisted optical absorption in indirect band gap materials. In addition, our theory predicts sub-gap phonon-assisted optical absorption in direct gap materials, as well as an exponential edge which we tentatively assign to the Urbach tail. We also consider a semiclassical approach to the calculation of optical absorption spectra which simultaneously captures energy-level renormalization and phonon-assisted transitions and is especially suited to first-principles electronic structure calculations. We demonstrate this approach by calculating the phonon-assisted optical absorption spectrum of bulk silicon.},

This allows for a systematic study of many?body e?ects using nonlinear optical spectroscopy.

    abstract  	 = {The early-stage density oscillations of the electronic charge in molecules irradiated by an attosecond XUV pulse takes place on femto- or subfemtosecond time scales. This ultrafast charge migration process is a central topic in attoscience because it dictates the relaxation pathways of the molecular structure. A predictive quantum theory of ultrafast charge migration should incorporate the atomistic details of the molecule, electronic correlations, and the multitude of ionization channels activated by the broad-bandwidth XUV pulse. We propose a first-principles nonequilibrium Green’s function method fulfilling all three requirements and apply it to a recent experiment on the photoexcited phenylalanine amino acid. Our results show that dynamical correlations are necessary for a quantitative overall agreement with the experimental data. In particular, we are able to capture the transient oscillations at frequencies 0.15 and 0.30 PHz in the hole density of the amine group as well as their suppression and the concomitant development of a new oscillation at frequency 0.25 PHz after ∼14 fs.},

    abstract   	 = {Time-dependent density matrix functional theory can be formulated in terms of coupled-perturbed response equations, in which a coupling matrix K(omega) features, analogous to the well-known time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) case. An adiabatic approximation is needed to solve these equations, but the adiabatic approximation is much more critical since there is not a good "zero order" as in TDDFT, in which the virtual-occupied Kohn-Sham orbital energy differences serve this purpose. We discuss a simple approximation proposed earlier which uses only results from static calculations, called the static approximation (SA), and show that it is deficient, since it leads to zero response of the natural orbital occupation numbers. This leads to wrong behavior in the omega -> 0 limit. An improved adiabatic approximation (AA) is formulated. The two-electron system affords a derivation of exact coupled-perturbed equations for the density matrix response, permitting analytical comparison of the adiabatic approximation with the exact equations. For the two-electron system also, the exact density matrix functional (2-matrix in terms of 1-matrix) is known, enabling testing of the static and adiabatic approximations unobscured by approximations in the functional. The two-electron HeH+ molecule shows that at the equilibrium distance, SA consistently underestimates the frequency-dependent polarizability alpha(omega), the adiabatic TDDFT overestimates alpha(omega), while AA improves upon SA and, indeed, AA produces the correct alpha(0). For stretched HeH+, adiabatic density matrix functional theory corrects the too low first excitation energy and overpolarization of adiabatic TDDFT methods and exhibits excellent agreement with high-quality CCSD ("exact") results over a large omega range.},

It is shown that static and dynamical charges are not driven by the same underlying parameters. A uni?ed treatment of dynamical charges in periodic solids and large clusters is proposed. The origin of the difference between static and dynamical charges is discussed in terms of local polarizability and delocalized transfers of charge: local models succeed in reproducing anomalous effective charges thanks to large atomic polarizabilities but, in ABO3 compounds, ab initio calculations favor the physical picture based upon transfer of charges. Various results concerning barium and strontium titanates are presented. The origin of anomalous Born effective charges is discussed thanks to a band-by-band decomposition which allows us to identify the displacement of the Wannier center of separated bands induced by an atomic displacement. The sensitivity of the Born effective charges to microscopic and macroscopic strains is examined. Finally, we estimate the spontaneous polarization in the four phases of barium titanate},

Spectral red shifts, sharpening of spectral lines, and a transfer of oscillator strength into the vibronic ground states of the electronic transitions are observed. Photoinduced absorption due to long-lived charged excitations, previously reported for less ordered PPV, could not be detected in this material. Photoconductivity excitation spectra show a steep rise at the absorption edge with no appreciable offset between the onsets for photoconduction and absorption. A very slow photocurrent component is observed, which the authors associated with the trapping and subsequent thermal release of photocarriers.},

    abstract  	 = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as promising two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors for optoelectronic and flexible devices. However, a microscopic explanation of their photophysics, of pivotal importance for the understanding and optimization of device operation, is still lacking. Here, we use femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, with pump pulse tunability and broadband probing, to monitor the relaxation dynamics of single-layer MoS2 over the entire visible range, upon photoexcitation of different excitonic transitions. We find that, irrespective of excitation photon energy, the transient absorption spectrum shows the simultaneous bleaching of all excitonic transitions and corresponding red-shifted photoinduced absorption bands. First-principle modeling of the ultrafast optical response reveals that a transient bandgap renormalization, caused by the presence of photoexcited carriers, is primarily responsible for the observed features. Our results demonstrate the strong impact of many-body effects in the transient optical response of TMDs even in the low-excitation-density regime.},

    abstract  	 = {High harmonic light sources make it possible to access attosecond timescales, thus opening up the prospect of manipulating electronic wave packets for steering molecular dynamics. However, two decades after the birth of attosecond physics, the concept of attosecond chemistry has not yet been realized; this is because excitation and manipulation of molecular orbitals requires precisely controlled attosecond waveforms in the deep UV, which have not yet been synthesized. Here, we present a unique approach using attosecond vacuum UV pulse-trains to coherently excite and control the outcome of a simple chemical reaction in a deuterium molecule in a non-BornÃ¢ÂÂOppenheimer regime. By controlling the interfering pathways of electron wave packets in the excited neutral and singly ionized molecule, we unambiguously show that we can switch the excited electronic state on attosecond timescales, coherently guide the nuclear wave packets to dictate the way a neutral molecule vibrates, and steer and manipulate the ionization and dissociation channels. Furthermore, through advanced theory, we succeed in rigorously modeling multiscale electron and nuclear quantum control in a molecule. The observed richness and complexity of the dynamics, even in this very simplest of molecules, is both remarkable and daunting, and presents intriguing new possibilities for bridging the gap between attosecond physics and attochemistry.},

It is shown that both methods lead to identical and unambiguous predictions for observable quantities as long as the atomic wavefunctions are transformed when used in the minimal-coupling formulation. The physical meaning of kinetic momentum is used to show that the atomic states must be described by wavefunctions calculated in the absence of an electromagnetic field when using the <B>d</B> &#183; <B>E</B> (but not the <B>p</B> &#183; <B>A</B>) form of the interaction Hamiltonian. When, however, observables are calculated using the common approximations of resonance atomic physics - the two-level approximation and the rotating-wave approximation - the two formulations can lead to measurably different results. This point is illustrated by calculating the induced polarization (and hence the refractive index) of an atomic system for the two exactly soluble cases of the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom.},

By adjusting the dielectric constant, we can reproduce the observed exciton energies in the resonance Raman spectra and two-photon absorption spectra for SWNTs. The environmental effect on the transition energies can be explained by a diameter-dependent dielectric constant. However, the energy difference between the dark and bright exciton states cannot be reproduced simply by changing the dielectric constant consistently. Thus we need to consider the evaluation of the Coulomb interaction, especially with regard to the surrounding materials.},

The ultra-fast dynamics measured experimentally is, instead, due to the scattering between degenerate L states that is activated by the non-symmetric population of the conduction bands induced by the laser field. This ultra-fast relaxation is, then, entirely due to the specific experimental setup and it can be interpreted by introducing a novel definition of the quasi-particle lifetimes in an out-of-equilibrium context.},

Our understanding of this effect is, however, based on the assumption that the electrons are strictly confined on the tube surface, on trajectories that are not modified by curvature effects. Using an ab initio approach based on density functional theory, we show that this assumption fails at the nanoscale inducing important corrections to the physics of the Aharonov?Bohm effect. Curvature effects and electronic density that is spilled out of the nanotube surface are shown to break the periodicity of the gap oscillations. We predict the key phenomenological features of this anomalous Aharonov?Bohm effect in semiconductive and metallic tubes and the existence of a large metallic phase in the low flux regime of multiwalled nanotubes, also suggesting possible experiments to validate our results.},

Time-resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy of flash-photolyzed L29F MbCO revealed a short-lived CO intermediate whose 140-ps lifetime is shorter than that found in wild-type protein by a factor of 1000. The electron density maps of the protein unveil transient conformational changes far more dramatic than the structural differences between the carboxy and deoxy states and depict the correlated side-chain motion responsible for rapidly sweeping CO away from its primary docking site.},

Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy is used to resolve this process in silicon in real time. Electrons injected into the conduction band by few-cycle laser pulses alter the silicon XUV absorption spectrum in sharp steps synchronized with the laser electric field oscillations. The observed ~450-attosecond step rise time provides an upper limit for the carrier-induced band-gap reduction and the electron-electron scattering time in the conduction band. This electronic response is separated from the subsequent band-gap modifications due to lattice motion, which occurs on a time scale of 60 ± 10 femtoseconds, characteristic of the fastest optical phonon. Quantum dynamical simulations interpret the carrier injection step as light-field–induced electron tunneling.},

Both films show similar photoelectron energy distribution curves determined by the long-alkyl chain. The intramolecular energy-band dispersion of polyethylene was determined from the photon-energy dependence of the normal-emission spectra. This is the first direct observation of an energy-band dispersion in organic solids. The upper bands formed by C 2p and H 1s electrons extend from 8.8 to 15.5 eV below the vacuum level, and the deeper-lying bands originating from C 2s electrons lie from 17.5 to 24.7 eV. The band structure obtained is compared to results from XPS and ESR studies. Furthermore, the experimentally determined band structure is discussed in detail in view of theoretical calculations for polyethylene. Ab initio and extended H?ckel calculations give a good description of the experimental results.},

This method provides a simple procedure for deriving formulas for the energy shift of a single level and for the energies and wave functions of degenerate and quasi-degenerate states. It also allows one to derive formulas for the transition and scattering amplitudes. Application of the method to resonance scattering processes yields a systematic theory for the spectral line shape. The practical ability of the method is demonstrated by deriving formulas for the \QED\ and interelectronic-interaction corrections to energy levels and transition and scattering amplitudes in one-, two-, and three-electron atoms. Numerical calculations of the Lamb shift, the hyperfine splitting, the bound-electron g factor, and the radiative recombination cross section in heavy ions are also reviewed.},

We determined that multiphoton absorption of the 800-nm femtosecond laser excitation creates a large population of excited carriers with excess energy. Screening of the Coulomb interaction by the excited free carriers causes damping of the exciton resonance and renormalization of the band gap causing broadband (2.3?3.5 eV) changes in the dielectric function of ZnO. From the dielectric function, many transient material properties, such as the index of refraction of ZnO under excitation, can be determined to optimize ZnO-based devices.},

The 1s-2p transition energy of excitons in Si that locates around 12 meV (?3 THz) is directly probed by the broadband terahertz pulses. The resonance energy of the 1s-2p transition stays unchanged with increasing the photo-excited electron-hole (e-h) pair density. The resonance structure sustains even above the Mott density, although broadened, in contrast to the conventional picture of the exciton Mott transition where the exciton binding energy vanishes toward the Mott density. The results indicate the existence of excitonic correlation in the metallic electron-hole plasma phase (? 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

This decay necessarily involves an electronic spin flip. The intrinsic decay mechanism due to interband spin–flip dipole moment perpendicular to the monolayer plane, gives a rate about 100–1000 times smaller than that of bright excitons. However, we find that this mechanism also introduces an energy splitting due to a local field effect, and the whole oscillator strength is contained in the higher-energy component, while the lowest-energy state remains dark and needs an extrinsic spin–flip mechanism for the decay. Rashba effect due to a perpendicular electric field or a dielectric substrate, gives a negligible radiative decay rate (about 10 7 times slower than that of bright excitons). Spin flip due to Zeeman effect in a sufficiently strong in-plane magnetic field can give a decay rate comparable to that due to the intrinsic interband spin–flip dipole.},

The basic tool is the so-called Ansatz decoupling; one Ansatz family stems from the original Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz and is suitable for extending the quasi-particle picture of the Landau theory out of equilibrium. The other family based on the Generalized KB Ansatz is appropriate for short time transients. The physical and formal context of the Ansatzes is analyzed; the most important question explored is the status of the Reconstruction Theorems, reducing a full description of a non-equilibrium system to a dynamic theory in terms of one-particle quantities. A comparison is made between the Time Dependent Density Functional Theory and the properly renormalized NGF formalism. There is a close relationship between both formalisms. The Reconstruction Theorems form a general basis for obtaining improved quantum transport equations.},

    abstract  	 = {When electron-hole pairs are excited in a semiconductor, it is a priori not clear if they form a plasma of unbound fermionic particles or a gas of composite bosons called excitons. Usually, the exciton phase is associated with low temperatures. In atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, excitons are particularly important even at room temperature due to strong Coulomb interaction and a large exciton density of states. Using state-of-the-art many-body theory, we show that the thermodynamic fission–fusion balance of excitons and electron-hole plasma can be efficiently tuned via the dielectric environment as well as charge carrier doping. We propose the observation of these effects by studying exciton satellites in photoemission and tunneling spectroscopy, which present direct solid-state counterparts of high-energy collider experiments on the induced fission of composite particles.},

    abstract  	 = {Black phosphorus has attracted interest as a material for use in optoelectronic devices due to many favorable properties such as a high carrier mobility, field-effect, and a direct bandgap that can range from 0.3 eV in its bulk crystalline form to 1.7–2.0 eV for a single atomic layer. The low bandgap energy for multilayer black phosphorus consisting of more than approximately five atomic layers allows for direct transition photoabsorption that enables detection of light out to mid-infrared frequencies. In this work, we characterize the room temperature optical response of a black phosphorus photoconductive detector at wavelengths ranging from 1.56 to 3.75 μ m. Pulsed autocorrelation measurements in the near-infrared regime reveal a strong, sub-linear photocurrent nonlinearity with a response time of 1 ns, indicating that gigahertz electrical bandwidth is feasible. Time resolved photoconduction measurements covering near- and mid-infrared frequencies show a fast 65 ps rise time, followed by a carrier relaxation with a time scale that matches the intrinsic limit determined by autocorrelation. The sublinear photoresponse is shown to be caused by a reduction in the carrier relaxation time as more energy is absorbed in the black phosphorus flake and is well described by a carrier recombination model that is nonlinear with excess carrier density. The device exhibits a measured noise-equivalent power of 530 pW Hz −1/2 , which is the value expected for Johnson noise limited performance. The fast and sensitive room temperature photoresponse demonstrates that black phosphorus is a promising new material for mid-infrared optoelectronics.},

The calculated spectra clearly show the crossover behavior between the e-h BCS state and the excitonic Bose-Einstein condensate. The analysis is based on the generalized random-phase approximation combined with the Bethe-Salpeter equation. This approach allows us to consider the strong and weak e-h pair correlations on the same basis. In particular, we ?nd that the broad spectral component arising from the carrier recombination in the e-h BCS state splits into the P and P 2 lines with decreasing e-h density. This behavior can be predicted neither by the BCS-like mean-?eld theory nor by the interacting Boson model. The result agrees with a recent noteworthy experiment for the strongly excited ZnO, where the ultraviolet laser emission was observed at room temperature},

Including only two electrons isolates and examines the effect that the highest occupied molecular orbital has on the Kohn-Sham potential as the molecule dissociates. We reproduce the characteristic step and peak that previous high-level wave function methods have shown to exist for real molecules in the low-density internuclear region. The simplicity of our model enables us to investigate in detail their development as a function of bond-length, with little computational effort, and derive properties of their features in the dissociation limit. We show that the onset of the step is coincident with the internuclear separation at which an avoided crossing between the ground-state and lowest charge-transfer excited-state is approached. Although the step and peak features have little effect on the ground-state energetics, we discuss their important consequences for dynamics and response.},

This conclusion is based on numerical experiments on 1D He in which the exact TD is compared with the exact adiabatic potential Vxc. * the exact Vs (and thus Vxc) is found by inversion of the TDKS equation. * the exact adiabatic Vxc instead requires the GS Vs corresponding to the TD density at a given t, considered as GS density, and the GS external potential corresponding to the same density (that will be different from the "real" external TD potential) The three systems are: A. He in dc electric field B. He with a forcing that mimics nuclei motion C. He in strong, time-dependent external ?elds due to powerful laser pulses (780 nm) In the first two cases the TDSE is solved and at every step from the corresponding TD density the exact and adiabatic is found In the third cases to assess the accuracy of the adiabatically exact approxi- mation in practice: propagate the KS orbital while using at every time step the adiabatically exact approximation of vc that is obtained self-consistently from the KS density. In A. Vc adiabatic = Vc exact In B Vc adiabatic \= Vc exact In C same quantitative ionization behavior Questions: How is the adiabatic potential found in C? (not really clear) Is the GS external potential corresponding to GS density still obtained by inversion of the SE?? In this case to construct the trajectory in the adiabatic case we need not only Vc, but also Vext (not known and not possible in general to obtain).

We compare the exact time evolution of these systems to the adiabatically exact one obtained from time-dependent Kohn-Sham calculations relying on the exact ground-state exchange-correlation potential. Thus, we can show under which conditions the adiabatic approximation breaks down and memory effects become important. The hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics allows us to interpret these results and relate them to dissipative effects in the Kohn-Sham system. We show how the breakdown of the adiabatic approximation can be inferred from the rate of change of the ground-state noninteracting kinetic energy.},

    abstract   	 = {One of the most important conceptual achievements of DFT is the possibility to formulate the many-body problem in a form of a closed theory that contains only a restricted set of basic variables, such as the density in the static DFT, or the density and the current in TDDFT. In classical physics, a theory of this type is known for more than two centuries. This is classical hydrodynamics. In fact, the Runge-Gross mapping theorem in TDDFT [Runge 1984] proves the existence of the exact quantum hydrodynamics. In this respect, static equilibrium DFT should be viewed as the exact quantum hydrostatics. It is indeed known that the condition of the energy minimum is equivalent to the condition for a local compensation of the external and the internal stress forces exerted on every in.nitesimal volume element of the system in equilibrium [Bartolotti 1980]. Interestingly, the equations of TDDFT in the hydrodynamic formulation can be also considered as a force balance condition, but in a local noninertial reference frame moving with the .ow. In the time-dependent case there is a local compensation of the external, inertial, and internal stress forces. This demonstrates a close similarity of static DFT and TDDFT in the co-moving frame. The above similarity was the main motivation to reconsider the formulation of TDDFT from the point of view of a local observer in the co-moving Lagrangian reference frame [Tokatly 2005a, Tokatly 2005b]. One of the goals of this work is to present the Lagrangian formulation of TDDFT in a compact and physically transparent form. Simple numerical illustrations of this approach for one-dimensional dynamics can be found in a recent paper [Ullrich 2006].},

    abstract   	 = {We present a constructive derivation of a time-dependent deformation functional theory?a collective variable approach to the nonequilibrium quantum many-body problem. It is shown that the motion of infinitesimal fluid elements (i.e., a set of Lagrangian trajectories) in an interacting quantum system is governed by a closed hydrodynamics equation with the stress force being a universal functional of Green's deformation tensor gij. Since the Lagrangian trajectories uniquely determine the current density, this approach can be also viewed as a representation of the time-dependent current-density functional theory. To derive the above theory, we separate a ?convective? and a ?relative? motions of particles by reformulating the many-body problem in a comoving Lagrangian frame. Then, we prove that a properly defined many-body wave function (and thus any observable) in the comoving frame is a universal functional of the deformation tensor. Both the hydrodynamic and the Kohn-Sham formulations of the theory are presented. In the Kohn-Sham formulation, we derive a few exact representations of the exchange-correlation potentials, and discuss their implication for construction of nonadiabatic approximations. We also discuss a relation of the present approach to a recent continuum mechanics of the incompressible quantum Hall liquids.},

    abstract   	 = {The past decades have witnessed a breathtaking progress in semiconductor device fabrication techniques, with a relentless trend towards miniaturization. Nowadays, semiconductor nanostructures of almost any desired design can be grown with a precision down to a single atomic layer by using epitaxial methods. To confine, manipulate, and control the charge and spin carriers in semiconductor nanostructures, one can vary the material or alloy composition of a sample along the growth direction, which gives rise to quantum wells or superlattices with sharp interfaces. Gradual changes of alloy composition are also possible, for example to grow parabolic quantum wells. Free electrons or holes are supplied by remote or modulation doping (the doping centers are physically separated from the wells), which leads to systems with very high mobilities. Finally, the sample is gated, and static electric fields can be applied. The above methods provide the toolbox used for ?band engineering.? An easy-to-read introduction to band engineering from a historic perspective is given in the Nobel Lecture by Herbert Kroemer [Kroemer 2001]. Out of the vast number of textbooks and monographs on semiconductor nanostructures, the book by Davies is particularly recommended [Davies 1998].},

An exact (i.e., nonadiabatic) extension of the ground-state LDA into the dynamical regime leads to a Vxc(r,t) with a memory, which causes the electron dynamics to become dissipative. To illustrate and explain this nonadiabatic behavior, this paper studies the dynamics of two interacting electrons on a two-dimensional quantum strip of finite size, comparing TDDFT within and beyond the ALDA with numerical solutions of the two-electron time-dependent Schr?dinger equation. It is shown explicitly how dissipation arises through multiple particle-hole excitations, and how the nonadiabatic extension of the ALDA fails for finite systems but becomes correct in the thermodynamic limit.},

This paper studies nonadiabatic effects for excitation energies, using the current?density functional of Vignale and Kohn [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 2037 (1996)]. We derive a general analytic expression for nonadiabatic corrections to excitation energies of finite systems and calculate singlet s-->s and s-->p excitations of closed-shell atoms. The approach works well for s-->s excitations, giving a small improvement over the adiabatic local-density approximation, but tends to overcorrect s-->p excitations. We find that the observed problems with the nonadiabatic correction have two main sources: (1) the currents associated with the s-->p excitations are highly nonuniform and, in particular, change direction between atomic shells, (2) the so-called exchange-correlation kernels of the homogeneous electron gas, f<sub>xc</sub><sup>L</sup> and f<sub>xc</sub><sup>T</sup>, are incompletely known, in particular in the high-density atomic core regions.},

The popular adiabatic local-density approximation (ALDA) for Vxc(r,t) uses only densities at the same space-time point (r,t). To go beyond the ALDA, two local approximations have been proposed based on quantum hydrodynamics and elasticity theory: (a) using the current as the basic variable (C-TDDFT) [G. Vignale, C. A. Ullrich, and S. Conti, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 4847 (1997)], (b) working in a comoving Lagrangian reference frame (L-TDDFT) [I. V. Tokatly, Phys. Rev. B 71, 165105 (2005)]. In this paper we illustrate, compare, and analyze both nonadiabatic theories for simple time-dependent model densities in the linear and nonlinear regime, for a broad range of time and frequency scales. C- and L-TDDFT are identical in certain limits, but, in general, exhibit qualitative and quantitative differences in their respective treatment of elastic and dissipative electron dynamics. In situations where the electronic density rapidly undergoes large deformations, it is found that nonadiabatic effects can become significant, causing the ALDA to break down.},

We focus on two particular systems, for both of which experimental results are available: a wide single square well and a narrow asymmetric double quantum well. The aim is to calculate the frequency and linewidth of collective electronic modes damped through electron-electron interaction only. Since Landau damping, i.e., creation of single electron-hole pairs, is not effective here, the dominant damping mechanism involves dynamical exchange-correlation effects such as multipair production. To capture these effects, one has to go beyond the widely used adiabatic local-density approximation (ALDA) and include retardation effects. We perform a comparative study of two approaches which fall in this category. The first one is the dynamical extension of the ALDA by Gross and Kohn. The second one is a more recent approach which treats exchange and correlation beyond the ALDA as viscoelastic stresses in the electron liquid. It is found that the former method is more robust: it performs similarly for strongly different degrees of collectivity of the electronic motion. Results for single and double quantum wells compare reasonably to experiment, with a tendency towards overdamping. The viscoelastic approach, on the other hand, is superior for systems where the electron dynamics is predominantly collective, but breaks down if the local velocity field is too rapidly varying, which is the case for single-electron-like behavior such as tunneling through a potential barrier.},

It is mainly because of this fact that, even after years of intensive studies, the exact form of the xc potential as a functional of the density remains unknown. Nevertheless, it is true that many accurate and useful results can be obtained from the use of an approximation ? the local density approximation (LDA) ? which ignores the problem altogether. Apparently, the nonlocal dependence of the Kohn-Sham orbitals on the density is sufficient in many cases to give the right quantum chemistry. Furthermore, a number of successful strategies have been designed to go beyond the LDA when needed: in one such approach (the generalized gradient approximation ? GGA) one goes beyond the LDA by including the dependence of the xc potential on the gradient of the local density; in another one expresses the xc potential as a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, and, finally, in the ?meta-GGA? approach one fights the problem by including additional local variables, such as the kinetic energy density.},

    abstract  	 = {Black phosphorus (BP) has gained renewed attention due to its singular anisotropic electronic and optical properties that might be exploited for a wide range of technological applications. In this respect, the thermal properties are particularly important both to predict its room temperature operation and to determine its thermoelectric potential. From this point of view, one of the most spectacular and poorly understood phenomena is indeed the BP temperature-induced band gap opening; when temperature is increased, the fundamental band gap increases instead of decreases. This anomalous thermal dependence has also been observed recently in its monolayer counterpart. In this work, based on ab initio calculations, we present an explanation for this long known and yet not fully explained effect. We show that it arises from a combination of harmonic and lattice thermal expansion contributions, which are in fact highly interwined. We clearly narrow down the mechanisms that cause this gap opening by identifying the peculiar atomic vibrations that drive the anomaly. The final picture we give explains both the BP anomalous band gap opening and the frequency increase with increasing volume (tension effect).},

    abstract   	 = {Decoherence is central to our understanding of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. It is also a way of probing the dynamics of interacting many-body systems. Photoexcited semiconductors are such systems in which the transient dynamics can be studied in considerable detail experimentally. Recent advances in spectroscopy of semiconductors provide powerful tools to explore many-body physics in new regimes. An appropriate theoretical framework is necessary to describe new physical e?ects now accessible for observation. We present a possible approach in this thesis, and discuss results of its application to an experimentally relevant scenario. The major portion of this thesis is devoted to a formalism for the multi-dimensional Fourier spectroscopy of semiconductors. A perturbative treatment of the electromagnetic ?eld is used to derive a closed set of di?erential equations for the multi-particle correlation functions, which take into account the many-body e?ects up to third order in the ?eld. A diagrammatic method is developed, in which we retain all features of the double-sided Feynman diagrams for bookkeeping the excitation scenario, and complement them by allowing for the description of interactions. We apply the formalism to study decoherence between the states of optically excited excitons embedded in an electron gas, and compare it with the decoherence between these states and the ground state. We derive a dynamical equation for the two-time correlation functions of excitons, and compare it with the corresponding equation for the interband polarization. It is argued, and veri?ed by numerical calculation, that the decay of Raman coherence depends sensitively on how di?erently the superimposed exciton states interact with the electron gas, and that it can be much slower than the decay of interband polarization. We also present a new numerical approach based on the length gauge for modeling the time-dependent laser-semiconductor interaction. The interaction in the length gauge involves the position operator for electrons, as opposed to the momentum operator in the velocity gauge. The approach is free of the unphysical divergences that arise in the velocity gauge. It is invariant under local gauge symmetry of the Bloch functions, and can handle arbitrary electronic structure and temporal dependence of the ?elds.},

On the basis of a nonequilibrium Green's function technique (Keldysh formalism) we study the system of electrons and holes, interacting among themselves and with the exciting pulse. A set of coupled equations for the oneparticle Green's function and the transverse and longitudinal polarizability is derived, which is valid for arbitrary excitation conditions. For an initially prepared state, which is not too far from a quasiequilibrium state of the excited system, the theory is elaborated in detail, using a screened Hartree-Fock approximation scheme. Within this approximation earlier results of various theoretical approaches are found to be special cases of the equilibrium limit of the present theory.},

They also provide insight into the nature of excited states in these one-dimensional systems. Recent work suggests that light absorption produces strongly correlated electron-hole states in the form of excitons. However, it has been difficult to rule out a simpler model in which resonances arise from the van Hove singularities associated with the one-dimensional bond structure of the nanotubes. Here, two-photon excitation spectroscopy bolsters the exciton picture. We found binding energies of ?400 millielectron volts for semiconducting single-walled nanotubes with 0.8-nanometer diameters. The results demonstrate the dominant role of many-body interactions in the excited-state properties of one-dimensional systems.},

Our results show a sharp increase of the carrier lifetimes with the number of layers in the sample. Carrier lifetimes increase from few tens of picoseconds in monolayer samples to more than a nanosecond in 10-layer samples. The inverse carrier lifetime was found to scale according to the probability of the carriers being present at the surface layers, as given by the carrier wave function in few layer samples, which can be treated as quantum wells. The carrier lifetimes were found to be largely independent of the temperature, and the inverse carrier lifetimes scaled linearly with the photoexcited carrier density. These observations are consistent with defect-assisted carrier recombination, in which the capture of electrons and holes by defects occurs via Auger scatterings. Our results suggest that carrier lifetimes in few-layer samples are surface recombination limited due to the much larger defect densities at surface layers compared with the inner layers.},

    abstract   	 = {Black phosphorus is a newly rising layered material with tremendous and intriguing physical, chemical, and electronic properties. Recently, it was reintroduced into the community from the perspective of two-dimensional (2D) materials, showing excellent carrier mobility, strong light--matter interactions in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, and unique anisotropic physical properties. These features are beyond the existing 2D materials in terms of bandgap range and mobility/bandgap trade-off, making it possible to bridge the application gaps ranging from mid-IR photonics to high-performance field-effect devices. In this paper, we review the status and perspectives of the optical properties of black phosphorus, with a particular emphasis on their broadband tunable bandgap and anisotropic optical properties. We began with a brief introduction on the history, synthesis, crystal/band structures, and basic physical properties of black phosphorus. In Section 3, we discuss the optical properties of black phosphorus, including comparison of the electronic-excitation-induced versus phonon-excitation-induced optical properties, linear versus nonlinear absorption, and static versus dynamic photoresponse, as well as the quasi-particle effect versus the effect. After that, we exemplify typical black phosphorus photonic devices in Section 4. We highlight recent progress in photodetectors covering mid-IR and terahertz wavelength, ultrafast Q-switching and mode-locking pulse lasers and nanophotonic devices. Finally, we present a summary and outlook of black phosphorus regarding current challenges and future application opportunities in Section 5.},

    abstract  	 = {Abstract The lattice dynamical theory of light scattering by entropy fluctuations has been developed using explicitly phonon-transport theory. Special emphasis has been put on the mechanisms of coupling of light to the entropy fluctuations. The usually considered indirect coupling via density fluctuations, which leads to the Landau-Placzek ratio for the intensities of first and second sound, is shown to be insufficient in many cases. From an analysis of experimental elasto-optic and thermo-optic constants we conclude that for a number of materials the direct coupling will be decisive for describing light scattering in the hydrodynamic regime. The direct coupling is shown to renormalize the elasto-optic constants, so that in the quasistatic limits the isothermal and adiabatic elasto-optic coefficients follow from microscopic theory in agreement with thermodynamics.},

Two different quantum-mechanical approaches are discussed: the time-dependent Schr?dinger equation and time-dependent density functional theory. We show that when solving the time-dependent Schr?dinger equation, small errors in the initial ground-state wave function can be magnified considerably during propagation. A scheme is presented to efficiently obtain the ground state with high accuracy. We further demonstrate that the commonly-used absorbing boundary conditions can severely influence the results. The requirements on the boundary conditions are somewhat less stringent in effective single-particle approaches such as time-dependent density functional theory. We point out how results from accurate wave-function based calculations can be used to improve the density functional description of long-ranged, nonlinear electron dynamics. We present details of a method to reconstruct, numerically, the full, unapproximated, Kohn-Sham potential from the density and current of the exact system.},

Simulating such processes on a first-principles basis is a major theoretical challenge. We demonstrate that time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) on the basis of a newly developed functional for the correlation potential incorporates the relevant electron interaction effects. The central idea of our approach is to exploit information about exact ground-state correlation in approximate time-dependent calculations. The new functional provides an accurate description of the paradigm problem of the double ionization of the Helium atom, showing that TDDFT is a viable tool for strong-field calculations.},

The approximation is called N-adiabatic since it reproduces the exact number of integrated electron close to the nucleus. Besides memory effects, it neglets polarization of the density, and effect of the density away from the nucleus. (NB Here the Vext is not "touched")},

To demonstrate applicability, we field-ionized krypton atoms within a single wave crest and launched a valence-shell electron wavepacket with a well-defined initial phase. Half-cycle field excitation and attosecond probing revealed fine details of atomic-scale electron motion, such as the instantaneous rate of tunneling, the initial charge distribution of a valence-shell wavepacket, the attosecond dynamic shift (instantaneous ac Stark shift) of its energy levels, and its few-femtosecond coherent oscillations.},

    abstract  	 = {Abstract An exciton is an atomic hydrogen-like quasi-particle, consisting of a Coulombically bound pair of an electron and a hole in conduction and valence bands, respectively. While excitons are traditionally investigated by optical spectroscopies, photoelectron spectroscopy can be a powerful tool in providing a unique view on the energetics and dynamics of excitons in semiconductor materials. The experiment typically relies on time-resolved two-photon photoemission (TR-2PPE) spectroscopy in which the first laser pulse creates excitons in a material and the second laser pulse ionizes the excitons for detection. In this short note, I discuss unique insights provided by TR-2PPE on exciton dynamics in organic semiconductors and challenges in the application of this technique.},

    abstract  	 = {The application of femtosecond spectroscopy to the study of ultrafast dynamics in semiconductor materials and nanostructures is reviewed with particular emphasis on the physics that can be learned from it. Excitation with ultrashort optical pulses in general results in the creation of coherent superpositions and correlated many-particle states. The review comprises a discussion of the dynamics of this correlated many-body system during and after pulsed excitation as well as its analysis by means of refined measurements and advanced theories. After an introduction of basic concepts?such as coherence, correlation and quantum kinetics?a brief overview of the most important experimental techniques and theoretical approaches is given. The remainder of this paper is devoted to specific results selected in order to highlight how femtosecond spectroscopy gives access to the physics of coherences, correlations and quantum kinetics involving charge, spin and lattice degrees of freedom. First examples deal with the dynamics of basic laser-induced coherences that can be observed, e.g. in quantum beat spectroscopy, in coherent control measurements or in experiments using few-cycle pulses. The phenomena discussed here are basic in the sense that they can be understood to a large extent on the mean-field level of the theory. Nevertheless, already on this level it is found that semiconductors behave substantially differently from atomic systems. Subsequent sections report on the occurrence of coherences and correlations beyond the mean-field level that are mediated either by carrier?phonon or carrier?carrier interactions. The corresponding analysis gives deep insight into fundamental issues such as the energy?time uncertainty, pure dephasing in quantum dot structures, the role of two-pair or even higher correlations and the build-up of screening. Finally results are presented concerning the ultrafast dynamics of resonantly coupled excitations, where a combination of different interaction mechanisms is involved in forming new types of correlations. Examples are coupled plasmon?phonon and Bloch?phonon oscillations. The results reviewed in this paper clearly reveal the central role of many-particle correlations and coherences for the ultrafast dynamics of dense semiconductor systems. Both the presence of strong correlation effects and the formation of coherences in a genuine many-particle system have important implications for the controllability of optical signals from this class of materials, which is of utmost importance for applications in present-day and future optoelectronic devices.},

The existence of cutting rules is demonstrated for diagrams that can correspond to the expectation values of operator products, self-energies, etc. The rules permit one to express these quantities, as convolutions of retarded amplitudes with the Green's functions corresponding to densities, extending over the past of a many-body system. The quasiparticle limit of the results is discussed. As an example, the resummation is carried over the repeated interactions between excitations in a medium, for the self-energies that correspond to single-particle absorption and production rates. The imaginary nucleon optical potential, that is used in nuclear physics, is identical with the combination of the rates. Futher, the formulae for the absorption and production rates of collective excitations are derived.},

    abstract  	 = {Femtosecond optical pump–probe spectroscopy with 10 fs visible pulses is employed to elucidate the ultrafast carrier dynamics of few-layer MoS2. A nonthermal carrier distribution is observed immediately following the photoexcitation of the A and B excitonic transitions by the ultrashort, broadband laser pulse. Carrier thermalization occurs within 20 fs and proceeds via both carrier–carrier and carrier–phonon scattering, as evidenced by the observed dependence of the thermalization time on the carrier density and the sample temperature. The n–0.37±0.03 scaling of the thermalization time with carrier density suggests that equilibration of the nonthermal carrier distribution occurs via non-Markovian quantum kinetics. Subsequent cooling of the hot Fermi–Dirac carrier distribution occurs on the ∼0.6 ps time scale via carrier–phonon scattering. Temperature- and fluence-dependence studies reveal the involvement of hot phonons in the carrier cooling process. Nonadiabatic ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which predict carrier–carrier and carrier–phonon scattering time scales of 40 fs and 0.5 ps, respectively, lend support to the assignment of the observed carrier dynamics.},

The classical tool yielding the kinetic equations, the Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz, has been improved and generalized to a whole Ansatz family including the so-called extended quasi-particle approximation. Each Ansatz produces a quantum kinetic theory: a quasi-particle kinetic equation and a functional of the quasi-particle distribution returning the average values of observables. In the extended quasi-particle model, the theory is physically consistent: causal, gauge invariant and conserving. This model leads to kinetic equations for dense Fermi liquids which combine the Landau quasi-particle drift with non-local scattering integrals in the spirit of the Enskog equation.},
